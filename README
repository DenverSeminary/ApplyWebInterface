Python-based web service for users to check on the status of the file loads

External Python Dependencies:
-----------------------------
* tornado (deps: simplejson, pycurl)
* 
* httplib2 - interaction with the tracking database


Usage:
------------------------------
python main.py



Additional Information:
------------------------------
Database is Kyoto Cabinet/Tycoon on lindev (until Tycoon is ported to Windows). You must make sure that's running if this process is to work.



Future Plans:
------------------------------
1. New process logging system that records successes ( TotalRecords, Start, Finish ) {currently only failures are logged}
2. For files that are out of sync (file downloaded but no load attempt made), allow the user to queue/schedule/run the process for that file
